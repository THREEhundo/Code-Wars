# CodeWars Challenges: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/THREEhundo" >Visit Profile</a> 

![alt tag]()
A repository of all of the codewars challenges (kata's) I've completed. Currently Ranked 6 kyu. I push solutions daily.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

The first thing I do when firing up my laptop each morning is a daily challenge. 

## Optimizations

I previously had all my completed kata's in a single file. I moved each individual challenge into it's own file for organization and to not have multiple challenge functions being called at once. 

## Lessons Learned:

There are so many different ways to complete a challenge. No matter how slick I think my answer is, there is always someone providing a one line answer...always.
