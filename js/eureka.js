/**
 * Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....Â¡Eureka!!
 *
 * The number 89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata.
 *
 * What's the use of saying "Eureka"?
 *
 * Because this sum gives the same number.
 *
 * In effect: 89 = 8^1 + 9^2
 *
 * The next number in having this property is 135.
 *
 * See tgus property again: 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3
 *
 * We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers a, b that defines the range [a, b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.
 *
