/*** Ping Pong	6/26
/***************************/

/***
 * While Mrs Pong is away visiting her sister, Mr Pong has foolishly set up a ping pong table in his lounge room, and invites his neighbour Mr Ping over for a friendly ping pong session.
 *
 * When Mr Ping hits the ping pong ball, the ping pong ball goes ping.
 *
 * When Mr Pong hits the ping pong ball, the ping pong ball goes pong.
 *
 * Unfortunately, not every hit goes where it was meant to...
 *
 * Sometimes the ping pong ball hits the net, or bounces off a wall, or it ricochets off Mrs Pong's rather expensive porcelain collection, a light fitting, or various pieces of lounge furniture, before finally coming to rest on the floor. When that happens there are all kinds of bad noises.
 *
 * Who scored the most points?
 *
 * !NOTES
 *
 * To score a point the same player must bopth serve and win the rally.
 *
 * Whoever picks the ball off the floor will serve next.
